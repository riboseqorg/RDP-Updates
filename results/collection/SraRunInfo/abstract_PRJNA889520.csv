abstract
"To investigate the cell type-specific expression features of dopaminergic neurons in ventral midbrain, we generated DAT-TRAP mice. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of samples collected from 3- and 18-month old mice. OVX were also bred to overexpress human alpha-synuclein. Short and long-read sequencing were performed. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for DAT-TRAP  samples in 3- and 18-month old mice, with and without human alpha-synuclein overexpression."
