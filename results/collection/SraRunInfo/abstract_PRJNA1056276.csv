abstract
The goal is to determine the contribution of zebrafish 5' UTR sequences to translation initiation. The 5' UTR MPRA reporter library was injected at the 1-cell stage and samples were collected during early stages of embryogenesis. Polysome profiling was performed to quantify ribosome occupancy of each 5' UTR reporter.
