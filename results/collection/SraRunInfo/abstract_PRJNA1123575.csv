"Characterization of shared patterns of RNA expression between genes across conditions has led to the discovery of regulatory networks and novel biological functions. However, it is unclear if such coordination extends to translation, a critical step in gene expression. Here, we uniformly analyzed 3,819 ribosome profiling datasets from 117 human and 94 mouse tissues and cell lines. We introduce the concept of Translation Efficiency Covariation (TEC), identifying coordinated translation patterns across cell types. We nominate potential mechanisms driving shared patterns of translation regulation. TEC is conserved across human and mouse cells and uncover novel gene functions. Moreover, our observations indicate that proteins that physically interact are highly enriched for positive covariation at both translational and transcriptional levels. Our findings establish translational covariation as a conserved organizing principle of mammalian transcriptomes. Overall design: Matched ribosome profiling and RNA-seq of PARK7, VIM, and USP42 knockout cell lines"
