"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are on the edge of innovation aimed at regenerative and therapeutic applications, including wound healing, by containing therapeutic agents originating from secreting cells. Moreover, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) play a role in wound healing because they have antiseptic activities. Therefore, in this study, we used sequencing technology to investigate the mRNA profile in UCMSC-derived exosomes (EXs). We also attempted to determine the role of the transcriptome, particularly in cutaneous wound healing, using bioinformatics analysis. Additionally, we investigated the efficacy of utilising a combination of UCMSC-derived EXs and AgNPs on burned animal models. Results showed that a large number of protein-coding genes (4578 genes) have been detected in UCMSC-derived EXs, among which 2004 genes are upregulated in exosomes while 2574 genes are downregulated compared to secreting cells. Interestingly, many genes enriched in exosomes were associated with the biology of the wound healing process. Gene ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated the upregulated exosomal genes belonging to GO terms and KEGG pathways related to signaling pathways such as DNA replication, ribosome, cell cycle, and pyrimidine metabolism. Further investigations that aimed to test exosomes and AgNPs in wound healing stimulation confirmed the faster healing capacity belongs to all exosomes, AgNPs, and a combination of EXs and AgNPs in the early healing process. The exosomes also expressed their capacity to enhance the dermal fibroblast proliferation. Our findings indicated the selective sorting of mRNAs into EXs, the potential of EXs, and the combination of EXs with AgNPs in cutaneous wound healing.

Overall design: To investigate the role of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) and their secretome in the regulation of wound healing, we isolated and cultured mesenchymal stem cells from the umbilical cord, and isolated exosomes secreted by these cells. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using RNA-seq of a triplicate of UCMSC-derived exosomes and their corresponding mother cells Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for UC-MSCs and their exosomes."
