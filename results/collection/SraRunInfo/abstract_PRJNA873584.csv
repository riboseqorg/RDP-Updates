abstract
"Through the translatome sequencing (Ribo-seq) of clinically obtained papillary thyroid carcinoma and its paired adjacent tissues, we tried to find the differences in the translation of various genes and evaluate the translation function of circular RNAs in the two tissues. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from Ribo-seq of 4 different pairs of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma tissue sample and adjacent normal tissue. At the translatome level, we screened out 247 circRNAs with translation ability. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of Ribo-seq data in 4 pairs of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma tissue sample and adjacent normal tissue."
