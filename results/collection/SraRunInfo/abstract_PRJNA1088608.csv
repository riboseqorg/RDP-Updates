abstract
"MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells exhibit upregulation of translation regulation factors and ribosome biogenesis proteins as a result of MYCN-driven transcriptional amplification. Here, we treated MYCN-amplified and non-amplified neuroblastoma cells with a novel translation inhibitor, amidino-rocaglate CMLD12824, to compare the defects in translational efficiency. Overall design: MYCN-amplified (Kelly) and non-amplified (SK-N-AS) neuroblastoma cells were treated for 1 hour with 10 nM CMLD12824 amidino-rocaglate compound and analyzed for changes in translational efficiency using ribosome profiling and bulk RNA sequencing."
