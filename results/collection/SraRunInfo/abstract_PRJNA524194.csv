abstract
"In the present study, we discover the presence of m2A in chloroplast rRNA and tRNA, as well as cytosolic tRNA, in multiple plant species. We identify six m2A-modified chloroplast tRNAs and two m2A-modified cytosolic tRNAs across different plants. Furthermore, we characterize three Arabidopsis m2A methyltransferases—RLMNL1, RLMNL2, and RLMNL3—which methylate chloroplast rRNA, chloroplast tRNA, and cytosolic tRNA, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that m2A37 promotes a relaxed conformation of tRNA, enhancing translation efficiency in chloroplast and cytosol by facilitating decoding of tandem m2A-tRNA-dependent codons. This study provides insights into the molecular function and biological significance of m2A, uncovering a layer of translation regulation in plants. Overall design: Translation efficiency was down-regulated in rlmnl3 mutant"
