"Cold stress poses a significant threat to the quality and productivity of lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.). While previous research has extensively explored the genomic and transcriptomic responses to cold stress in lychee, the translatome has not been thoroughly investigated. This study delves into the translatomic landscape of the 'Xiangjinfeng' cultivar under both control and low-temperature conditions using RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling. We uncovered a significant divergence between the transcriptomic and translatomic responses to cold exposure. Additionally, bioinformatics analyses underscored the crucial role of codon occupancy in lychee's cold tolerance mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the modulation of translation via codon occupancy is a vital strategy to abiotic stress. Specifically, the study identifies ribosome stalling, particularly at the E site AAU codon, as a key element of the translation machinery in lychee's response to cold stress. This work enhances our understanding of the molecular dynamics of lychee's reaction to cold stress and emphasizes the essential role of translational regulation in the plant's environmental adaptability."
