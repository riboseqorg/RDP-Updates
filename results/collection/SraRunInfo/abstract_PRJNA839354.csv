"To analyze the effect of global translation initiation inhibition associated to glucose deprivation on cytoplasmic lncRNAs levels, we performed RNA-Seq using WT, xrn1-delta and upf1-delta cells grown in glucose-containing complete synthetic medium (CSM) and then shifted for 16 min in glycerol- and ethanol-containing medium. In parallel, control cells were maintained for the same time in glucose-containing CSM. For the WT strains, we also included a treatment of 15 min with CHX (100 Âµg/ml final concentration) or an equal volume of DMSO (Mock). Overall design: Strand-specific total RNA-seq (2 biological replicates per condition)."
