"To understand the impact of ILF3 on macrophages, ribo-sequencing (ribosome profiling) is employed. This method allows for the comprehensive analysis of ILF3's influence on the translational landscape in macrophages, providing insights into how ILF3 affects protein synthesis and potentially regulates various macrophage functions."
