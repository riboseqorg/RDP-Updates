"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has profound effect on gene expression during infection of monocytes. We performed RNA-seq and RIBO-seq to analyze the extend to which HCMV reshapes the transciptome and translatome of infected monocytes. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for HCMV-infected, GMCSF, or MCSF treated monocytes of total mRNA and polysome-assoacted mRNA"
