abstract
"Mutations that introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) within protein-coding genes are associated with incurable and severe genetic diseases. Many PTC-associated disorders are life-threatening and have no approved medical treatment options. Suppressor transfer RNAs (sup-tRNAs) with the capacity to promote translational readthrough of PTCs represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat these conditions; however, developing novel sup-tRNAs with high efficiency and specificity often requires extensive engineering and screening. Moreover, these efforts are not always successful at producing more efficient sup-tRNAs. Here we show that a pyrrolysine tRNA (tRNAPyl), which naturally translates the UAG stop codon, offers an attractive scaffold for developing effective sup-tRNAs that restore protein synthesis from PTC-containing genes. We created a series of rationally designed Pyrrolysine tRNA Scaffold Suppressor-tRNAs (PASS-tRNAs) that are substrates of bacterial and human alanyl-tRNA synthetase. Using a PTC-containing fluorescent reporter gene, PASS-tRNAs restore protein synthesis to wild-type levels in bacterial cells. In human cells, PASS-tRNAs display robust and consistent PTC suppression in multiple reporter genes, including pathogenic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 associated with breast and ovarian cancer. Moreover, PTC suppression occurred with high codon specificity and no observed cytotoxic effects. Collectively, these results unveil a class of sup-tRNAs with great potential for tRNA-based therapeutics. Overall design: Ribosome protected footprint libraries were prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with a sup-tRNA-expressing plasmid or an empty vector control to determine the impact of sup-tRNA expression on native stop codon readthrough."
