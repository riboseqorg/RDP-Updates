abstract
"These data belong to a collection of RNA-seq and ribosome profiling from cardiac left ventricles and iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte cell cultures from four primate species, in order to investigate the evolution of translational control and new transcription and translation events in primate hearts. Evolutionary innovations can be driven by changes in translation regulation and the emergence of new genes and open reading frames (ORFs). We found that the translational efficiencies of complexes IV and V of the oxygen consumption and energy production system (OXPHOS) show rapid evolutionary changes across mammalian evolution. Our comparative analyses revealed hundreds of evolutionary innovations with potential implications for primate cardiac development and disease. Overall, this resource sheds light on new evolutionary and functional aspects of transcription and translation in cardiac development, providing a foundation for future studies on human health and disease."
