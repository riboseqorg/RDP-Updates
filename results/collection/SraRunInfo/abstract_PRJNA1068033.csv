"The nucleolus is a membraneless condensate in eukaryotic cell nucleus, which is composed of three layers of fibrillar center (FC), dense fibrillar component (DFC), as well as granular component (GC) and regulates ribosome biogenesis1,2. The first step in nucleolar biogenesis is transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes, termed as nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), which is binding by upstream binding factor (UBF) and other transcription-associated proteins3-6. However, whether any molecule early onset of rDNA is involved in nucleolar biogenesis remains unknown. Here, we analyze the candidate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) encoded microproteins, preferentially as proteins, based on the nucleoli mass spectrometry (MS) data and identify 7 potential proteins that may be enriched in the nucleolus. Among these proteins, FuHsi solely builds a site that subsequently recruits rDNA, UBF and other transcription-associated proteins to initiate the nucleolus biogenesis. Functionally, FuHsi depletion leads to a dissolved nucleolus, as indicated by the disappearance of rDNA, FC, DFC and GC. Deficient FuHsi impairs rDNA transcription and subsequent ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, Fuhsi is an evolutionarily conserved protein in mouse, and homolog protein can functionally replace each other in vitro. The heterozygous Fuhsi knockout (KO) mice die within four weeks, and exhibit small size as well as decreased weight, in concordance with the decreased ribosome biogenesis, who are rescued by transgenic human FuHsi. This study reveals that FuHsi is a core protein that initiates nucleolar biogenesis and regulates mouse development. Overall design: To identify the potential function of FuHsi in nucleolus, we performed expression profiling analysis on FuHsi-knockdown (KD) cells."
