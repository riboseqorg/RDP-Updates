"In order to profile the translation events that were regulated by FBXO32, Ribo-seq was performed on PANC-1 cells which was used to generate FBXO32 stably depleted pancreatic cancer cells. Overall design: FBXO32-depleted or control PANC-1 cells were collected for ribosome profiling analysis to uncover potential downstream genes regulated by FBXO32 at the translational level. There were two bioreplicates for each group."
