abstract
"The avian cerebellum is known for its relatively large size and high degree of development, functioning as a crucial region for multisensory integration and motor control, particularly important for flight. This study aimed to investigate changes in gene expression in the cerebellum of racing pigeons using RNA-Seq analysis. The researchers analyzed samples from 10 racing homers' cerebellums before and after a 300 km flight back to their loft. The findings revealed that flight induces ribosome impairment in the cerebellum, suggesting potential alterations in the protein synthesis machinery due to prolonged flight activity as response to stress and maintain homeostasis. Overall design: The profiling of cerebellum transcriptome was performed on 5 samples obtained from racing homers competing in a 300 km flight and 5 birds of the same age form the same loft but which rested in the loft on the day of the competition.  The performing group upon their return and the control group were sedated and deceased using the cervical dislocation method"
