abstract
Ribosome profiling analysis of wild type prototrophic Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) MT1110 strain to examine global translational vs transcriptional profile change when exposed to cold shock from 30°C to 10°C in minimal liquid medium. Overall design: Comparative transcriptome vs translatome analysis using RNAseq and ribosome profiling data for wild type Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) MT1110 exposed to cold-shock stress.
