"Quality control of translation is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Obstacles in translation elongation induce ribosome collision, which is monitored by multiple sensor mechanisms in eukaryotes. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf598 recognizes collided ribosomes, triggering ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) to rescue stalled ribosomes and no-go decay (NGD) to degrade stall-prone mRNAs. However, the impact of RQC and NGD on maintaining the translational homeostasis of endogenous mRNAs has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the endogenous substrate mRNAs of NGD during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) of zebrafish development. RNA-Seq analysis of zebrafish znf598 mutant embryos revealed that Znf598 downregulates mRNAs encoding the C2H2-type zinc finger domain (C2H2-ZF) during the MZT. Reporter assays and disome profiling indicated that ribosomes stall and collide while translating tandem C2H2-ZFs, leading to mRNA degradation by Znf598. Our results suggest that NGD maintains the quality of the translatome by mitigating the risk of ribosome collision at the abundantly present C2H2-ZF sequences in the vertebrate genome. Overall design: RNA-seq"
