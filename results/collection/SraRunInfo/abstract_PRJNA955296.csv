abstract
"Mitochondrial rRNAs play important roles in regulating mtDNA-encoded gene expression and energy metabolism subsequently. However, the proteins that regulate mitochondrial 16S rRNA processing remain poorly understood. Herein, we generated adipose-specific Wbscr16-/- mice and cells, both of which exhibited dramatic mitochondrial changes. Subsequently, WBSCR16 was identified as a 16S rRNA-binding protein essential for the cleavage of 16S rRNA-mt-tRNALeu, facilitating 16S rRNA processing and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Additionally, WBSCR16 recruited RNase P subunit MRPP3 to nascent 16S rRNA and assisted in this specific cleavage. Furthermore, evidence showed that adipose-specific Wbscr16 ablation promotes energy wasting via lipid preference in brown adipose tissue, leading to excess energy expenditure and resistance to obesity. In contrast, overexpression of WBSCR16 upregulated 16S rRNA processing and induced a preference for glucose utilization in both transgenic mouse models and cultured cells. These findings suggest that WBSCR16 plays essential roles in mitochondrial 16S rRNA processing in mammals, and is the key mitochondrial protein to balance glucose and lipid metabolism. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for Floxed brown adipose tissues and WBSCR16 knockout tissues (Floxed and AWBSCR16 KO)."
