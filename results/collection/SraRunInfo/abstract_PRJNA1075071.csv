abstract
"The ability to genetically encode noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) has empowered proteins with improved or novel properties. However, existing strategies in mammalian cells rely on the introduction of blank codon for incorporating ncAAs, which is very inefficient and limits their widespread applications. Here, we develop a rare codon recoding strategy that takes advantage of the relative rarity of the TCG codon to achieve highly selective and efficient ncAA incorporation through systematic engineering and big data model predictions. We highlight the broad utility of this strategy for the incorporation of dozens of ncAAs into various functional proteins at the wild-type protein expression levels, as well as the synthesis of proteins with up to 6-site ncAAs or 4 distinct ncAAs in mammalian cells for downstream applications. Overall design: We found that co-expession of reporter could reduce the background incorporation of ncAA in proteome, when our TCG recoding translation system was performed. To explain Given the high recoding efficiency of the engineered TCG recoding system, we wondered whether it would lead to high background incorporation in the proteome and affect cell viability. For this purpose, We perform the Ribo-seq."
