"To elucidate the role of METTL14-mediated m6A modification in epidermal development, we conditionally knocked out the m6A methyltransferase METTL14 in mouse epidermal keratinocytes. We then performed ribosome-profiling analysis of epidermal keratinosis from P0 control mice (K14Cre,Mettl14F/+) and cKO mice (K14CreMettl14F/F). Overall design: We performed ribosome-profiling analysis of epidermal keratinosis from P0 control mice (K14Cre,Mettl14F/+) and cKO mice (K14CreMettl14F/F)."
