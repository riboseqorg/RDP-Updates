"Translational regulation in in vivo tissue environments during viral pathogenesis has hardly been scrutinized due to the lack of tissue translatomes upon viral infection despite a number of the translatome studies on virus-infected cells cultured in vitro. We constructed the first temporal profile of lung translatomes during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by applying ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to a severe COVID-19 mouse model. Unexpectedly, we observed gradual accumulations of non-canonical Ribo-seq reads representing hitherto-unidentified ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that are likely involved in impeded translational elongation in the infected tissues. Contemporarily developing ribosome heterogeneity with prominently deviated 5S rRNP association supported the malfunction of elongating ribosomes. The analyses of canonical Riboseq reads (ribosome footprints) highlighted two obstructive characteristics to host gene expression: attenuated translation for transcriptionally up-regulated genes including immune response genes and ribosome stalling on codons within transmembrane domain-coding regions. Our study elucidates hidden molecular features of gene regulation in vivo underlying SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Overall design: RNA-seq for lung tissues of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice infected by SARS-CoV-2. For the library construction, we divided conditions as two groups, the early set (Control for the early set, 1 day post-infection, 2 days post-infection) and late set (Control for the late set, 5 days post-infection, 7 days post-infection). For each condition, we prepared quadruplets."
