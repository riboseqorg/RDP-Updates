abstract
"Sunitinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that is widely used for treatment of various types of cancer. Vascular toxicity represents a debilitating side-effect of sunitinib which impends its application in some patients. Study of sunitinib has been primarily focused on transcriptional control, and there is an important gap in our understanding of its impact on translation. To interrogate the role of mRNA translation in mediating the effect of sunitinib on endothelial cells (ECs) we performed ribosome footprinting. Overall design: Ribosome footprinting was performed on two healthy human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) that were treated with DMSO or sunitinib (2ÂµM) for 24 hours."""
