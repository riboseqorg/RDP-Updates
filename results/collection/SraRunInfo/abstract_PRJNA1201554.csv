abstract
"This study examines crop sacs from 225-day-old unpaired, non-lactating male pigeons (MN) alongside males that initiated lactation on the first day after incubation (ML). Through ribosome profiling, we observed a significant upregulation of genes linked to ribosome assembly and protein synthesis in ML samples compared to MN."
