abstract
"This study provides RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling data for patient-derived cell lines and patient tissue samples for children with medulloblastoma. Ribosome profiling is a variant protocol of RNA-sequencing that directly sequences ribosome-bound RNA fragments only. Associated RNA-seq and Ribo-seq data obtained separately for some cancer cell lines can be found on the NCBI SRA as PRJNA957428. Samples were processed for poly-A mRNA sequencing using the Roche Kapa Kit. Ribosome profiling was performed as described in the manuscript referenced below (Hofman et al.) and based on the article by McGlincy et al., Methods (2017). Ribo-seq data were analyzed for sample quality using RiboseQC (Calviello, Nat Struct Mol Biol, 2020). These data were used to quantify P-sites of open reading... (for more see dbGaP study page.)"
