abstract
"Plants have developed the ability to adjust to the day/night cycle through the expression of diel genes, which allow them to effectively respond to environmental changes and optimise their growth and development. Diel oscillations also have substantial implications in many physiological processes, including photosynthesis, floral development, and environmental stress responses. The expression of diel genes is regulated by a combination of the circadian clock and responses to environmental cues, such as light and temperature. A great deal of information is available on the transcriptional regulation of diel gene expression. However, the extent to which translational regulation is involved in controlling diel changes in expression is not yet clear. To investigate the impact of translational regulation on diel expression, we conducted Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses on a time-series sample of Arabidopsis shoots cultivated under a 12?h light/dark cycle. Our results showed that translational regulation is involved in about 71% of the genes exhibiting diel changes in mRNA abundance or translational activity, including clock genes, many of which are subject to both translational and transcriptional control. They also revealed that the diel expression of glycosylation and ion-transporter-related genes is mainly established through translational regulation. The expression of several diel genes likely subject to translational regulation through upstream open-reading frames was also determined."
