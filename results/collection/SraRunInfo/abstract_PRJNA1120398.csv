"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) modulate various physiological functions by re-wiring cellular gene expression in response to extracellular signals. Control of gene expression by GPCRs has been studied almost exclusively at the transcriptional level, neglecting an extensive amount of regulation that takes place translationally. Hence, little is known about the nature and mechanisms of gene-specific post-transcriptional regulation downstream of receptor activation. Here, we apply an unbiased multiomics approach to delineate an extensive translational regulatory program initiated by the prototypical beta2-adrenergic receptor (ß2-AR) and provide mechanistic insights into how these processes are orchestrated. Using ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), we identify nearly 120 novel gene targets of adrenergic receptor activity for which expression is exclusively regulated at the level of translation. We next show that all translational changes are induced selectively by endosomal ß2-ARs and report that this proceeds through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Specifically, within the set of translational GPCR targets we discover significant enrichment of genes with 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs, a gene class classically known to be translationally regulated by mTOR. We then demonstrate that endosomal ß2-ARs are required for mTOR activation and subsequent mTOR-dependent TOP mRNA translation. This site-selective crosstalk between the pathways is observed in multiple cell models with native ß2-ARs, across a range of endogenous and synthetic adrenergic agonists, and for other GPCRs with intracellular activity. Together, this comprehensive analysis of drug-induced translational regulation establishes a critical role for location-biased GPCR signaling in fine-tuning the cellular protein landscape. Overall design: To investigate transcription and translation responses downstream of ß2-AR, we conducted parallel RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in HEK293 cells. Cells were incubated with DMSO or Dyngo (dynamin inhibitor) for 20 minutes, then stimluated with 1uM Isoproterenol. RNAseq samples were isolated through standard library preparation. Ribo-seq samples were prepared by isolating ribosome-protected-fragments and small RNA library preparation"
