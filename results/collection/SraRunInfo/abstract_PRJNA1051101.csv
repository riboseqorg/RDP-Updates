abstract
"In this study, we generated transcriptome profiles from HEK293T,  HEK293T ?YB-1?YB-3, and HEK293T ?YB-1?YB-3 with the restored expression of YB-1 and/or YB-3. The data are used to explore YB-1 and YB-3 influence on transcriptome and translatome and their functional interchangeability in transcription and translation. Overall design: We established double knockout HEK293T ?YB-1?YB-3 cells with the CRISPR/Cas approach. Next, we obtained derivatives of the double knockout HEK293T?YB-1?YB-3 cells stably expressing full-length YB-1 and/or YB-3 mRNA. RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq data obtained from HEK293T, HEK293T ?YB-1?YB-3, and HEK293T ?YB-1?YB-3 with restored YB-1 and/or YB-3 expression in normal conditions."
