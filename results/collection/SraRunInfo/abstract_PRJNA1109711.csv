abstract
"Mitochondrial biogenesis relies on both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and imbalance in their expression can lead to inborn errors of metabolism, inflammation, and aging. Here, we investigate N6AMT1, a nucleo-cytosolic methyltransferase that exhibits genetic codependency with mitochondria. We determine transcriptional and translational profiles of N6AMT1 and report that it is required for the cytosolic translation of TRMT10C (MRPP1) and PRORP (MRPP3), two subunits of the mitochondrial RNAse P enzyme. In the absence of N6AMT1, or when its catalytic activity is abolished, RNA processing within mitochondria is impaired, leading to the accumulation of unprocessed and double-stranded RNA, thus preventing mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, and leading to an immune response. Our work sheds light on the function of N6AMT1 in protein synthesis and highlights a cytosolic program required for proper mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall design: Established N6AMT1-depleted and control human chronic myelogenous K562 cell lines using lentiviral transduction of CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA."
