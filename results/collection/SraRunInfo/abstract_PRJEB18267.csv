"Ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) (maps positions of translating ribosomes on the transcriptome), RNASeq (quantifies the transcriptome) ad microRNA-seq (quantifies miRNA) analysis of Chlamydomonsa reinhardtii (CC1885) dcl3 mutant and its corresponding complement. Samples were biological triplicates of vegetative cells at mid-log phase and was cryogenically harvested."
