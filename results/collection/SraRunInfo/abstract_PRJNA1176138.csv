"The interplay between ribosomal protein composition and mitochondrial function is essential for sustaining energy homeostasis. Precise stoichiometric production of ribosomal proteins is crucial to maximize protein synthesis efficiency while reducing the energy costs to the cell. However, the impact of this balance on mitochondrial ATP generation, morphology and function remains unclear. Particularly, the loss of a single copy ribosomal protein gene is observed in Mendelian disorders like Diamond Blackfan Anemia and is common in somatic tumors, yet the implications of this imbalance on mitochondrial function and energy dynamics are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of haploinsufficiency for four ribosomal protein genes implicated in ribosomopathy disorders (rps-10, rpl-5, rpl-33, rps-23) in Caenorhabditis elegans and corresponding reductions in human lymphoblast cells. Our findings uncover significant, albeit variably penetrant, mitochondrial morphological differences across these mutants, alongside an upregulation of glutathione transferases, and SKN-1 dependent increase in oxidative stress resistance, indicative of increased ROS production. Specifically, loss of a single copy of rps-10 in C. elegans led to decreased mitochondrial activity, characterized by lower energy levels and reduced oxygen consumption. A similar reduction in mitochondrial activity and energy levels was observed in human leukemia cells with a 50% reduction in RPS10 transcript levels. Importantly, we also observed alterations in the translation efficiency of nuclear and mitochondrial electron transport chain components in response to reductions in ribosomal protein genes' expression in both C. elegans and human cells. This suggests a conserved mechanism whereby the synthesis of components vital for mitochondrial function are adjusted in the face of compromised ribosomal machinery. Finally, mitochondrial membrane and cytosolic ribosomal components exhibited significant covariation at the RNA and translation efficiency level in lymphoblastoid cells across a diverse group of individuals, emphasizing the interplay between the protein synthesis machinery and mitochondrial energy production. By uncovering the impact of ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency on the translation efficiency of electron transport chain components, mitochondrial physiology, and the adaptive stress responses, we provide evidence for an evolutionarily conserved strategy to safeguard cellular functionality under genetic stress. Overall design: Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq libraries of C. elegans heterozygous mutants for four different ribosomal protein genes (rpl-5, rpl-33, rps-23 and rps-10)"
