abstract
"Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC and OPSCC) represents an increasing problem in the global public health. OPSCC is the most frequent malignancy in oral cavity, with an overall increasing incidence and mortality. In view of its unclear exact mechanism and lack of optimized prevention and treatment methods, new biomarkers are needed to characterize the diversity of cancer and to explore effective treatment targets. This study combined translatomics and transcriptomics to analyze the differential genes in human oral cancer and adjacent tissues, in order to provide a new perspective for the prevention and treatment of OPSCC. Overall design: Ribosome profiling sequencing of oral mucosa of human that divived into tumor tissue and paracancerous tissue of oral cavity carcinomas"
