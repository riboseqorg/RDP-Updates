abstract
We used ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to generate a translatome map for the archaeon M. mazei under two growth conditions. The analysis of the datasets allowed to generate a high confidence inventory of small proteins in the model archaeon M. mazei and their regulation under nitrogen limiting conditions. Overall design: Ribo-seq and RNA-seq experiments to study the transcriptome and the translatome of M. mazei in two growth conditions.
