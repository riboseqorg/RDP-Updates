"The goal of this experiment is to analyze differences in translation of mRNA transcripts in absence vs presence of Rbfox1 using ribosome profiling of Rbfox1-cKO and control mature primary neuronal cultures Overall design: E15 cortical cultres from a Rbfox1 fl/fl pregnant mouse were plated in 10cm plates, cells were infected with AAV-hSyn-Cre-eGFP or AAV-hSyn-eGFP at DIV3, harvested cells at DIV14. Two technical replicates per sample type"
