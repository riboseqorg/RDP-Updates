"Cancer cells rely on metabolic reprogramming to sustain the prodigious energetic requirements for rapid growth and proliferation. Glutamine metabolism is frequently dysregulated in cancers and is being exploited as a potential therapeutic target. In current study, we identified TARBP1 (TAR (HIV-1) RNA Binding Protein 1) as a novel driver gene critical for glutamine metabolic reprogramming in tumor through the CRISPRi/Cas9 screening. Our in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that TARBP1 is the methyltransferase of Guanosine 2'-O-methylation targeting position 18 (G18) of tRNAGln (TTG/CTG) and tRNASer (TGA/GCT), and loss of Gm18 modification diminishes the stability of tRNAs. Therefore, TARBP1 is critical for maintaining efficient translation of mRNA, in particular the glutamine transportor-ASCT2 (also known as SCL1A5). Importantly, TARBP1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in HCC, consequentially promotes the protein synthesis of ASCT2 and glutamine import to fuel the growth of cancer cell, which is associated with poor patient survival. Taken together, this study reveals the critical role of TARBP1 in HCC progression through glutamine metabolic reprogramming and provides a potential target for tumor therapy. Overall design: To identify the mRNAs translationally regulated by TARBP1, Ribo-seq were carried out in wild-type and TARBP1-KO cell lines. Input mRNAs and RPFs were isolated, ribosomal RNAs were depleted and cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced according to the TruSeq Ribo Profile pipeline (Illumina)."
