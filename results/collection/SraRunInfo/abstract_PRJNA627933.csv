abstract
"The overall success of a pathogenic microbe depends on the coordinated expression of virulence determinants. Regulatory circuits that drive pathogenesis are complex, multilayered and often not completely understood. Here, we reveal that alterations in tRNA modifications define pathogenic phenotypes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Growth phase-dependent enzymatic activity of GidA leads to differential introduction of carboxymethylaminomethyl-uridine (cmnm5U34) at uridine 34 of the anticodon  of selected tRNAs. Consequently, ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched in cognate codons of such tRNAs is enhanced. Specifically, the presence of GidA-dependent tRNA modifications influenced expression of genes encoding for virulence factors leading to a cellular proteomic shift towards pathogenic and well adapted physiological states. Our approach of profiling the consequences of chemical tRNA modifications is general in concept and provides a paradigm of how tRNA modifications govern gene expression programs and regulate phenotypic outcomes responsible for bacterial adaption to changing and challenging habitats prevailing in the host niche. Overall design: RNA-Seq profiles of gidA and ladS mutants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina HiSeq 2500"
