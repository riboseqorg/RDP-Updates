abstract
"We revealed the ABA signal regulation of protein translation efficiency and resulting in aberrant pre-rRNA processing, and found GRP7/8 mediated ABA signal regulation of translation by combing the Ribo-seq data and CLIP-seq data. The polysome profilings discovered that GRP7/8 also mediated the translation regulation of other abiotic stresses, such as drought, revealing novel regulation model for environmental stresses participation on plant growth."
