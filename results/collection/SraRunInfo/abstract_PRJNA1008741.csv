"To understand how RPL40 K22me3 transferred by SMYD5 affected ribosome function on normal culture condition or after mTOR inhibition, we conducted ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-seq)  in Huh7 control (NC) and SMYD5 KO cells. Overall design: Huh7 control (NC) and SMYD5 KO cells were culturedHuh7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S or treated by 50 nM Torin1 for 12 hrs before collecting. Ribo-seq was performed as ARTseq Ribosome Profiling Kit's instructions with modifications. About 10^7 cells were pre-treated by 100 µg/ml cycloheximide (MCE) for 10 min at 37?, then washed and collected by ice-cold PBS containing 100 µg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were lysed by 120 µl Mammalian Polysome Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Trion X-100 with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) for 10 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10min at 4?. 10 ul lysate was kept for input and purified by RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit (RCC-5 R1016, zymo), followed by rRNA removal with Ribo-off rRNA Depletion (N406, Vazyme) and library preparation with VAHTS Universal RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (NR605, Vazyme). Add about 30U RNase I (EN0601, Thermo) to 100ul lysate and digest for 45 min at room temperature. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 4 µl of Superase-In (AM2696, Thermo). Meanwhile, MicroSpin S-400 HR columns (27514001, Cytiva) were equilibrated with 3 ml of Mammalian Polysome Buffer by gravity flow and emptied by centrifugation at 600g for 4 min. We then immediately loaded 100 µl of the digested lysate on the column and eluted the column by centrifugation at 600g for 2 min. RNA was extracted by RCC-5 and separated on 15% denaturing urea-PAGE gel. After SYBR gold (S11494, Thermo) staining, the size ranges from 25 nt to 40 nt was cut out and recovered by small-RNA PAGE Recovery Kit (R1070, zymo). The eluted RNA were mix with Superase-In, T4 PNK and Buf A (EK0031, Thermo) at 37 ? for 15 min and supplemented by 1 mM ATP (R0441 ) for another 30 min before extraction by RCC-5 and generation library by Small RNA Library Prep Kit (NR811, Vazyme). The libraries were sequenced by NovaSeq 6000 (conducted by Nanjing Gaoxin Precision Medicine Technology Co., Ltd)."
