abstract
"To define the translational landscape of Xrn1-sensitive lncRNAs in yeast, we performed Ribo-Seq in WT and upf1 mutant cells, in native conditions or upon treatment with translation elongation inhibitor (cycloheximide). Overall design: Ribo-seq was performed on WT and upf1 mutant yeast cells, treated or not with cycloheximide, with 2 biological replicates per condition."
