abstract
"To evaluate the genome-wide changes in gene translational efficiency during the development of heart failure, we performed transverse aortic constriction(TAC) in male C57BL/6 mice. According to our experience, hypertrophy of the left ventricle  was observed 2 weeks after TAC. Cardiac decompensation was observed at 5 weeks. We collected left ventricular tissues at 0, 2, 5 weeks after TAC and then performed ribosome footprinting and sequencing."
