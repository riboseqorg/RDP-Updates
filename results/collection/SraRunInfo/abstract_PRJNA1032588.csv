abstract
This study elucidates the processes of transcription and translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae following MTF (Mitochondrial Transcription Factor) expression. We identifed the functional significance of MTF in the translation process through a comprehensive analysis of multi-omics data. Overall design: RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq were performed to understand translational mechanism in s. cerevisiae
