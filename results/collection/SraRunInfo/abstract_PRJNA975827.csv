abstract
"The overall success of bacterial pathogens depends on the coordinated expression of virulence determinants. Regulatory circuits that drive pathogenesis are complex, multilayered and incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that alterations in tRNA modifications define pathogenic phenotypes in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that the enzymatic activity of GidA leads to the introduction of a carboxymethylaminomethyl modification in selected tRNAs. Modifications at the wobble uridine base (cmnm5U34) of the anticodon alter ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched in cognate codons of such tRNAs. Specifically, in P. aeruginosa the presence of GidA-dependent tRNA modifications influenced expression of genes encoding virulence regulators, leading to a cellular proteomic shift towards pathogenic and well-adapted physiological states. Our approach of profiling the consequences of chemical tRNA modifications is general in concept. It provides a paradigm of how tRNA modifications govern gene expression programs and regulate phenotypic outcomes responsible for bacterial adaption to changing and challenging habitats prevailing in the host niche. Overall design: Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 mutant strains were planktonically cultured in LB to an OD600 of 0.4 (ribo seq experiment) or 2 (RNA seq experiment).domonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14 wild type and mutants strains cultivated in LB"
