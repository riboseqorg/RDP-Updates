abstract
"The oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) occurs in the absence of new transcription and relies on post-transcriptional gene regulation, including translational control by mRNA poly(A) tail regulation, where cytoplasmic polyadenylation activates translation and deadenylation leads to translational repression and decay. However, how the transcriptome-wide landscape of mRNA poly(A) tails shapes translation across the OET in mammals remains unknown. Here, we performed long-read RNA sequencing to uncover poly(A) tail lengths and mRNA abundance transcriptome-wide in mice across five stages of development from oocyte to embryo. Integrating these data with recently published ribosome profiling data, we demonstrate that poly(A) tail length is coupled to translational efficiency across the entire OET. We uncover an extended wave of global deadenylation during fertilization, which sets up a switch in translation control between the oocyte and embryo. In the oocyte, short-tailed maternal mRNAs that resist deadenylation in the oocyte are translationally activated, whereas large groups of mRNAs deadenylated without decay in the oocyte are later readenylated to drive translation activation in the early embryo. Our findings provide an important resource and insight into the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic polyadenylation and deadenylation dynamically shape poly(A) tail length in a stage-specific manner to orchestrate development from oocyte to embryo in mammals.
