"Nicotiana benthamiana plants were infected with Asparagus Virus 2 and its mutant version. Upper non-inoculated leaves were collected at various time points and used for sample preparation. RNA-seq was performed on the WT infected, mutant infected and mock uninfected samples. Ribo-seq was performed on the WT infected and mutant infected samples."
