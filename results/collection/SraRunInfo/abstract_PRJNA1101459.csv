abstract
"Natural products have a long history of providing potent probes into protein biosynthesis, with numerous molecules serving as valuable therapeutics. The marine natural product girolline has been described as an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that it is not a general translation inhibitor but represents a sequence-specific modulator of translation factor eIF5A. Girolline interferes with ribosome-eIF5A interaction and induces ribosome stalling, primarily on AAA-encoded lysine. Our data furthermore indicate that eIF5A plays a physiological role in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) and is important in maintaining the efficiency of translational progress. Girolline, therefore, provides a potent tool compound for understanding the interplay between protein production and quality control in a physiological setting and offers a new and selective means of modulating gene expression. numerous molecules serving as valuable therapeutics.
