abstract
"Photosynthesis requires chloroplasts, where most proteins are nucleus-encoded and produced via cytoplasmic translation. The translation initiation factor eIF5B gates the transition from initiation (I) to elongation (E), and the Kozak motif is associated with translation efficiency, but their relationship is previously unknown. Here, with ribosome profiling, we determined the genome-wide I-E transition efficiencies. We discovered that the most prevalent Kozak motif is associated with high I-E transition efficiency in Arabidopsis, rice, and wheat, thus implicating the Kozak motif in facilitating the I-E transition. Indeed, the effects of most Kozak motifs, including the most effective ones, depend on HOT3/eIF5B1 in Arabidopsis. HOT3 preferentially promotes the translation of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes in a Kozak motif-dependent manner, which explains the chloroplast defects of hot3 mutants. Our study reveals an evolutionarily-conserved link between the Kozak motif and eIF5B-mediated translational I-E efficiency and elucidates a HOT3-mediated translational control of nuclear photosynthesis genes for chloroplast biogenesis. Overall design: Arabidospsis seedlings and inflorescence. 12 RNA-seq libraries: 3 replicates for seedlings and inflorescence of WT and hot3-2."
