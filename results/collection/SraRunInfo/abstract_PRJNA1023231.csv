"Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) uses a number of strategies to modulate viral and host gene expression during its lifecycle. To characterize the transcriptional and translational landscape of HIV-1 infected cells, we used a combination of ribosome profiling, disome sequencing and RNA sequencing. We show that HIV-1 mRNAs are efficiently translated at all stages of infection, despite evidence for a substantial decrease in translational efficiency of host genes that are implicated in host cell translation. Our data also reveal novel upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the HIV-1 5' UTR as well as internal ORFs (iORFs) within the Vif and Pol coding domains. We observed ribosomal collisions in Gag-Pol upstream of the ribosome frameshift site that we attributed to a novel RNA structural fold using RNA structural probing and functional analysis. Antisense oligos designed to alter the base of this structure decreased frameshift efficiency. Overall, our data highlights the complexity of HIV-1 gene regulation and provides a key resource for decoding of host-pathogen interactions upon HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a novel RNA structural fold including the frameshift site that might be promising as a target for antiviral therapy. Overall design: To investigate the translational landscape of HIV-1 infected T-cells, we performed ribosome profiling experiments (RiboSeq, DisomeSeq) treated either with cycloheximide or harringtonine, as well as RNASeq at different timepoints of infection (mock, 8 hpi, 16 hpi, 24 hpi). Furthermore, we analyzed the HIV transcriptome present in the cell with Nanopore sequencing. Lastly, to investigate the structure of the ribosome frameshift site, we employed RNA structural probing (DMS-MaPseq)."
