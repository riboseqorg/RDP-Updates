abstract
"The cis-regulatory elements encoded in a mRNA determine its stability and translational output. While there has been a considerable effort to understand the factors driving mRNA stability, the regulatory frameworks governing translational control remain more elusive. We have developed a novel massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to measure mRNA translation, named Nascent Peptide Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (NaP-TRAP). NaP-TRAP measures translation in a frame specific manner through the immunocapture of epitope tagged nascent peptides of reporter mRNAs. We benchmark NaP-TRAP to polysome profiling and use it to quantify Kozak strength and the regulatory landscapes of five prime UTRs in the developing zebrafish embryo and in human cells. Through this approach we identified general and developmentally dynamic cis-regulatory elements, as well as potential trans-factor proteins. We find that U-rich motifs are general enhancers, and upstream ORFs and GC-rich motifs are global repressors of translation. We also observe a translational switch during the maternal-to-zygotic transition, where C-rich motifs shift from repressors to prominent activators of translation. Conversely, we show that microRNA sites in the five prime UTR repress translation following the zygotic expression of miR-430. Together these results demonstrate that NaP-TRAP is a versatile, accessible, and powerful method to decode the regulatory functions of UTRs across different systems."
