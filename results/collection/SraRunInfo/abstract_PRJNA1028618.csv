"In this study we examine the role of RACK1 MARylation in stress granule assembly and translational regulation in ovarian cancer cells. In addition, we describe the role of TARG1, an ADPR hydrolase enzyme in stress granule assembly and translation. Overall design: Ribo-seq (ribosome profiling) was performed on OVCAR3 cells with dox-mediated knockdown of endogenous RACK1 and re-expression of wildtype or MAR deficit mutant RACK1 proteins. We also performed Ribo-seq on OVCAR3 cells subjected to siRNA-mediated knockdown of TARG1."
