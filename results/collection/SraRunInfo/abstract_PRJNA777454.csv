abstract
"RNA-seq, monosome Ribo-seq, and disome Ribo-seq were performed to study the effect of deletion of ZNF-598 on No-Go mRNA Decay. Overall design: Analysis of wildtype and znf-598(-) C. elegans samples expressing a No-Go mRNA Decay reporter by RNA-seq, Ribo-seq using cycloheximide, and Ribo-seq using anisomycin."
