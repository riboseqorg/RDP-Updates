"The antibiotics chloramphenicol (CHL) and oxazolidinones including linezolid (LZD) are known to inhibit mitochondrial translation. This can result in serious, potentially deadly, side effects when used therapeutically. Although the mechanism by which CHL and LZD inhibit bacterial ribosomes has been elucidated in detail, their mechanism of action against mitochondrial ribosomes has yet to be explored. CHL and oxazolidinones bind to the ribosomal peptidyl transfer center (PTC) of the bacterial ribosome and prevent incorporation of incoming amino acids under specific sequence contexts, causing ribosomes to stall only at certain sequences. Through mitoribosome profiling, we show that inhibition of mitochondrial ribosomes is similarly context-specific â€“ CHL and LZD lead to mitoribosome stalling primarily when there is an alanine, serine, or threonine in the penultimate position of the nascent peptide chain. Our findings could help inform the rational development of future, less mitotoxic, antibiotics, which are critically needed in the current era of increasing antimicrobial resistance. Overall design: Mitochondrial ribosome profiling in human cells (HEK293) with and without antibiotic (chloramphenicol, linezolid, or retapamulin) treatment"
