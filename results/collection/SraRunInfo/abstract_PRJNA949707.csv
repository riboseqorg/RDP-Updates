abstract
"To investigate overaccumulated TTC3 inhibits translation initiation in Ltn1 KO neurons, we established harringtonine treated WT and Ltn1 KO mice primary cultured cortical neurons with Ttc3 RNAi or scrambled RNAi. We then performed read (footprint) count analysis at translation initiation site using data obtained from RNA-seq (Ribo-seq). Overall design: Comparative read count analysis of RNA-seq (Ribo-seq) data for WT and Ltn1 KO mice primary cultured cortical neurons and Tc3 KD derivatives."
