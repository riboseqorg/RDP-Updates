abstract
"To investigate the role of LRPPRC and mutant LRPPRC on the stability of the mitochondrially encoded mRNA transcripts. Overall design: Samples include two replicates each of mitochondrial ribosome profiling in LRPPRC KO + LSFC point mutant, along with matched RNA-seq prepared as described in Ingolia et al, 2012. The remaining 8 RNA-seq samples, also two replicates each, were prepared by novogen using their lncRNA library preparation service."
