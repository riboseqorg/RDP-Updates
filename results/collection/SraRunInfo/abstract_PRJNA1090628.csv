abstract
"The ability of reprogramming blank codons to encode non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) enables site-specific chemical functionality introduction. However, there are only three endogenous blank codons for translation termination in mammalian cells. To this end, we report a new approach termed RNA Codon Expansion (RCE) to create and reprogram post-transcriptionally modified RNA codons distinguishable with unmodified stop codons. To assess impact of our tools on off-target and gene expression, we conducted PRAISE-targeted sequencing, RNA-seq and ribosome profiling."
