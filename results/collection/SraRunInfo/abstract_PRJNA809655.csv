abstract
"Aberrant assembly and function of ribosomes are implicated in cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we find that 18S rRNA methyltransferase DIMT1 is essential for AML proliferation through a non-catalytic function. We demonstrate that a positively charged cleft on DIMT1 plays an important role in RNA binding. Mutations at the identified cleft (5mutA-DIMT1) significantly weakens binding of DIMT1 to rRNA in vitro and in cells. Strikingly, the RNA-binding deficient 5mutA-DIMT1 is predominantly located in the nucleoplasm, in contrast with the primarily nucleolar localization of wild-type DIMT1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rRNA binding is required for DIMT1 to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, which likely promotes DIMT1's nucleolar localization and its role in rRNA processing in cells. Importantly, re-expression of wild-type but not 5mutA-DIMT1 supports AML proliferation in competition-based cell proliferation assays. These results highlight the importance of targeting the catalytically independent RNA-binding activity of DIMT1 for therapy of AML. Overall design: Ribosome profiling followed by high-throughput sequencing (ribo-seq) in MOLM13C cells with DIMT1 or Rosa (a negative control) depletion."
