"Intramuscular fat (IMF) in pork holds significant importance for economic performance within the pig industry and dietary calcium supplementation enhances the accumulation of intramuscular fat. Additionally, calcium ions inhibit translation and reduce protein synthesis. However, the mechanism by which calcium regulates IMF deposition in muscle through translation remains largely unknown. In this study, we compared the ribosome profiles of the longissimus dorsi muscles of trigram pigs from the normal calcium (NC) group or calcium supplement (HC) group by Ribo-seq, and RNA-seq. By integrating multiple-omics analysis, we further discovered 437 genes that were transcriptionally unchanged but translationally altered and these genes Overall design: In this study, we compared the ribosome profiles of the longissimus dorsi muscles of trigram pigs from the normal calcium (NC) group or calcium supplement (HC) group by Ribo-seq, and RNA-seq."
