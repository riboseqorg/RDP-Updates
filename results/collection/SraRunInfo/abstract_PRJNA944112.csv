"In animal cells, growth factor signaling promotes both cell cycle progression and cell growth. To understand how the cell cycle is coupled to growth, we examined translational activities in human Retinal Pigment Epithelial cells by whole-transcriptome ribosome profiling. Overall design: We performed Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq on human RPE-1 cells that are serum starved for 18h, then serum stimulated for 5h, 10h, and 15h with 4 biological replicates each."
