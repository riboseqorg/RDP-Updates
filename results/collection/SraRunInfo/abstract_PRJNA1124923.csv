abstract
"This study used yak and cattle-yak testes from different developmental stages as materials to construct a complete translation map of the testes, and integrated transcriptome and translation results to explore gene expression changes during the sexual maturation process of yak testes. This study utilized Ribo seq technology to construct a transcriptome map of yak testicular development, revealing that the expression of genes related to spermatogenesis is specifically translated and regulated at different developmental stages. In addition, many unknown open reading frames (ORFs) in the testes have been newly identified. Overall design: Construction of ribosomal footprint map of yak and cattle-yak testes"
