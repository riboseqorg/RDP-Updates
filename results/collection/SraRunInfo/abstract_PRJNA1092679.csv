abstract
"This study investigates the influence of elongation factor P (EF-P) and its paralog EfpL (YeiP) on ribosome stalling at different motifs during translation in E. coli.RNA-seq and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) libraries were generated from E. coli strain BW25113 in four modifications: wild-type (WT), EF-P deletion mutant, EfpL deletion mutant and EF-P deletion mutant with overexpression of efpL.Illumina sequencing was conducted for all variants in three replicates."
