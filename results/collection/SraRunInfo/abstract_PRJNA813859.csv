abstract
"PABPC1 mediated protein synthesis control might be important for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) disease progression. Here, we use the PABPC1 enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation sequencing (eCLIP-seq) to capture PABPC1 directly bound RNAs as well as  the ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) to examine the ribosome protected mRNA fragments in control and PABPC1 silenced K562 cells. We integrated the eCLIP-seq and Ribo-seq data and found that 1496 out of the 6840 PABPC1 directly bound genes, significantly reduced their translation efficiency in PABPC1 silenced K562 cells. Strikingly, the 1496 genes with reduced translational efficiency enriched significant numbers of leukemogenesis oncogenes, such as BCR-ABL1, RPL22, SKP1, and MYCBP.  Among them, BCR-ABL1 mRNA translation was the most vigorous, which was also most influenced by PABPC1. Furthermore, we found that PABPC1 inhibition significantly suppressed the BCR-ABL1 downstream gene network in K562 cells (q value<0.001), indicating that BCR-ABL1 might be one of the main targets of PABPC1 in K562 cells. Overall design: RNA-seq and eCLIP-seq datasets."
