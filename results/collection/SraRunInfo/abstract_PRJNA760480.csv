abstract
"C-di-GMP signaling can directly influence bacterial behavior by affecting the functionality of c-di-GMP-binding proteins. In addition, c-di-GMP can exert an indirect and more global effect on gene transcription or translation, e.g. via riboswitches or by binding to transcription factors. In this study, we investigated the effects of changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels on gene expression and protein production in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We induced c-di-GMP production via an ectopically introduced diguanylate cyclase and recorded the transcriptional, translational as well as proteomic profile of the cells. We demonstrate that rising levels of c-di-GMP in P. aeruginosa under growth conditions otherwise characterized by low c-di-GMP levels immediately cause a switch to a non-motile, auto-aggregative phenotype. This switch became apparent before any c-di-GMP-dependent role on transcription, translation, or protein abundance could be observed. Our results indicate that sudden rises in global c-di-GMP pools affect the P. aeruginosa phenotype via an alteration of protein functionality, rather than an impact on global gene transcription or translation.
