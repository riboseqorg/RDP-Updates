abstract
"Various messenger RNA (mRNA) decay mechanisms play major roles in controlling mRNA quality and quantity in eukaryotic organisms under different conditions. While it is known that the recently discovered co-translational mRNA decay (CTRD), the mechanism that allows mRNAs to be degraded while still being actively translated, is prevalent in yeast, human, and various angiosperms, the regulation of this decay mechanism is less well studied. Moreover, it is still unclear whether this decay mechanism plays any roles in regulation of specific physiological processes in eukaryotes. Here, by re-analyzing the publicly available polysome profiling or ribosome footprinting and degradome sequencing datasets, we discovered that highly translated mRNAs tend to have lower co-translational decay levels. Based on this finding, we then identified Pelota and Hbs1, the translation-related ribosome rescue factors, as suppressors of co-translational mRNA decay in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we found that Pelota and Hbs1 null mutants have lower germination rates compared to the wild type plants, implying that proper regulation of co-translational mRNA decay is essential for normal developmental processes. In total, our study provides further insights into the regulation of CTRD in Arabidopsis and demonstrates that this decay mechanism does play important roles in Arabidopsis physiological processes. Overall design: GMUCT and mRNA-Seq libraries were constructed using 12-day-old seedlings of wild type (WT), Pelota and HBS1 null mutants"
