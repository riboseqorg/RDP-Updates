abstract
"We report the application of ChIP sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of histone modification in pancreatic cancer cells. We obtained 49.7 million reads from acetylated-H3K27 modified chromatin immunoprecipitated DNA from vehicle and acetate-treated pancreatic cancer cells. We find that lysine 27 acetylation effectively discriminates genes that are expressed, or stably induced upon acetate treatment. We identified genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and various metabolic pathways to be differentially acetylated in acetate-treated cells. The identification of these pathways provides link between cellular metabolism and chromatin status in the cells that can alter the pathophysiology of pancreatic cancer progression. Overall design: Examination of acetyl-H3K27 histone modification in pancreatic cancer cells. Two samples were analyzed."
