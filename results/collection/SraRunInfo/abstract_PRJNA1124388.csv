abstract
"Recent studies have suggested that mRNA internal m7G and its writer protein METTL1 are closely related to cell metabolism and cancer regulation. Here, we identify that IGF2BP family proteins IGF2BP1-3 can preferentially bind internal mRNA m7G. Such interactions, especially IGF2BP3 with m7G, could promote the degradation of m7G target transcripts in cancer cells. IGF2BP3 is more responsive to changes of the m7G modification, while IGF2BP1 prefers m6A to stabilize the bound transcripts. We also demonstrate that p53 transcript, TP53, is m7G-modified at its 3'UTR in cancer cells. In glioblastoma, the methylation level and the half lifetime of the modified transcript could be modulated by tuning IGF2BP3, or by site-specific targeting of m7G through a dCas13b-guided system, resulting in modulation of cancer progression and chemosensitivity. Overall design: Ribo-seq in HepG2 cells"
