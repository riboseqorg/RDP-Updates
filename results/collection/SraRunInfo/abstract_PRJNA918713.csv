abstract
"Exploring the mechanism of transformation and propagation of acute myeloid leukemia is still the key to solving its refractory and relapse-prone problems. Phase separation refers to the process of specific aggregation of biological macromolecules through multivalent binding, and then leads to the functional sectorization in cell. Despite the fact that phase separation has been related to the dysregulation of various cellular processes, its role in the malignant transformation and development of AML is still less characterized. Nucleolus, as a multilayer condensate formed by phase separation, is an important place for the initiation of ribosome formation, and its function is directly related to protein translation. High-resolution imaging and fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching experiments decode the positive regulatory relationship between the phase separation of FBL and the structure and function of nucleoli. Here, we used polysome profiling coupled with RNA-seq to depict transcriptome of AML cells with or without FBL knockdown. Overall design: Polysome profiling coupled with RNA-seq to depict transcriptome of AML cells with or without FBL knockdown."
