abstract
"A total of 10 cDNA libraries were constructed, representing 3 and 2 independent biological replicates of S. aureus strain KES34 (unmodified ribosomes) and KES30 (m6A2058-modified ribosomes), respectively. Translational efficiency (RPF/mRNA ratios), total mRNA abundance and ribosome density of each ORFs were calculated. Overall design: Investigating the translational efficiency and fidelity of unmodified- and m6A2058-modified ribosomes in a methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)."
