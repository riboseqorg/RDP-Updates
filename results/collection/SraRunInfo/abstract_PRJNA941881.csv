abstract
"We examined the mechanisms by which SMIP34 regulates EEC progression. EEC cells (HEC-1-A) were treated with either vehicle or SMIP34 20ÂµM for 24 hours, and total RNA was isolated for RNA-seq analysis. Our results demonstrated that PELP1 inhibition by SMIP34 reduces the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation. Overall design: Total RNA from HEC-1-A control, and SMIP34-treated cells were isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For whole-genome transcriptome profiling, 2 libraries (3 replicates from each group) were generated using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina Inc.). Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform (Illumina Inc.) using the 50 base-pair single-read (50SR) sequencing module."
