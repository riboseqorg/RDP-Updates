abstract
"Viruses affect the growth and productivity of crops similar to other pathogens like bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes. Chilli leaf curl virus (ChCLV) is one of the distressing pathogens of capsicum annum and a serious threat to chilli production worldwide. In this study, comprehensive transcriptome data have generated from the ChiLCV resistant and susceptible chili cultivars, which signifies the differential expression of several genes involved in defense, transcription, DNA organization, replication, transport, signaling, stress, ribosome assembly, the translation process, and resistance response against ChiLCV infection. Over-expression of defense-related genes in resistant chili variety could be correlated with ChiLCV resistance which may provide insight into the molecular mechanism of ChLCV infection in pepper and new strategies for developing virus-resistant crops."
