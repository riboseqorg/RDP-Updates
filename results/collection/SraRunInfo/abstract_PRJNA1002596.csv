"MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs that repress gene expression in both plants and animals and have diverse functions related to growth, development, and stress responses. The ribonuclease, DICER-LIKE1 is required for two steps in plant miRNA biogenesis: cleavage of the primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) to release a hairpin structure, called the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) and cleavage of the pre-miRNA to generate the miRNA/miRNA* duplex. The mature miRNA guides the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to target RNAs with complementary sequences, resulting in translational repression and/or RNA cleavage of target mRNAs. However, the relative contribution of translational repression versus mRNA degradation by miRNAs remains unknown at the genome-level in crops, especially in maize. The maize fuzzy tassel (fzt) mutant contains a hypomorphic mutation in DCL1 resulting in broad developmental defects. While most miRNAs are reduced in fzt, the levels of miRNA-targeted mRNAs are not dramatically increased, suggesting that translational regulation by miRNAs may be common. To gain insight into the repression mechanism of plant miRNAs, we combined ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing to globally survey miRNA activities in maize. Our data indicates that translational repression contributes significantly to regulation of most miRNA targets and that approximately one-third of miRNA targets are regulated primarily at the translational level. Surprisingly, ribosomes appear altered in fzt mutants suggesting that DCL1 may also have a role in ribosome biogenesis. Thus, DICER-LIKE1 shapes the translational landscape in plants through both miRNA-dependent and miRNA-independent mechanisms."
