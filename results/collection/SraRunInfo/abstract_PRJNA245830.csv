abstract
"We sequenced a total of 12 cDNA libararies derived from fragmented total mRNA and ribosome protected mRNAs from azithromycin-treated and -untreated S. aureus samples. The data represented 2 independent biological replicates. Overall design: Examination of the impact of azithromycin on global translatome, mRNA abundance and the ribosome density along the transcripts."
