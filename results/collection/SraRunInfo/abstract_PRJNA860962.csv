abstract
"Three translatomic approaches were applied to the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni to identify translated open reading frames, start codons, and stop codons and reveal novel small proteins Overall design: Total RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, TIS (translation initiation site) profiling (retapamulin and oncocin), and  TTS (translation termination site) profiling (apidaecin 137; monosomes and disomes) using apidaecin in Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168"
