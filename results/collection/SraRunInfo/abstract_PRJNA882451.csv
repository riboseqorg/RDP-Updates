abstract
"Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+B-ALL), characterised by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, remains a poor prognosis cancer that needs new therapeutic approaches. Transcriptomic profiling and pathway analysis identified up-regulation of the oncogenic transcription factors ERG and c-MYC,  with enrichment of genes involved in metabolic processes including ribosome biogenesis. Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data from defined cell populations. ChIP-seq from C57BL/6 proB cells and Rag1CreT/+;Erg?/? preproB cells."
