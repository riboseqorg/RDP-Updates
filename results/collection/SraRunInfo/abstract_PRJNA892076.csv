abstract
"Ribosome profiling analyses showed thousands of translated open reading frames in a cell encoding noncanonical peptides. To examine their functional roles, we stably overexpressed two noncanonical peptides (uSLC35A4 and iPGRMC1) in MCF-7 cells. And then we performed RNA-seq to examine differential gene expression upon gene overexpression. Overall design: We perform RNA-seq of MCF-7 cells overexpression wide-type ORF sequences. The start codon mutated sequences were used as the controls."
