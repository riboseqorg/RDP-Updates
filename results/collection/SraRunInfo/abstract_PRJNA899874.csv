abstract
"Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common cause of cancer death. Despite enormous technical advances in surgery and radiotherapy in the recent decade, survival of HNSCC patients has not markedly improved, with only 30% of patients diagnosed with advanced HNSCC that will survive for 5 years. This highlights the need to look into molecular processes leading to mechanisms of HNSCC radioresistance in HNSCC and identify novel radiosensitizers. A growing body of evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) containing small open reading frames (sORFs) produce biologically active micropeptides. We performed ribosome profilming of  radiosensitive and radioresistant HNSCC cells to identify the lncRNA-encoded micropeptides differentially expressed in radioresistance cellls.   Overall design: Ribosome profiling of parental radiosensitive SCC61 and radioresistant RTR61 cells"
