abstract
"We used parallel ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing to investigate the relationship between RNA editing and translation. Through systematically profiling mouse tissues from different developmental stages, we found dynamic changes in A-to-I RNA editome during retinal development. Further analysis revealed that altered translational efficiency in retinal development correlates with dynamics of A-to-I RNA editome. Overall design: RNAseq and ribosome profiling were performed for 7 times during mouse retina development and two repllicates per time. A total of 28 barcoded libraries were pooled and single-end 51 bp and strand-specific pair-end 125bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 for ribsome pforiling and RNAseq."
