"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) play a crucial role in maintaining the steady supply of blood cells throughout an organism's lifetime. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms governing HSC homeostasis is of particular importance for regenerative medicine and stem cell-based therapies. Translatome refers to the ensemble mRNA transcripts being actively translated on ribosomes within a cell type, under specific physio/pathological conditions. Translatome profiling provides insights into the regulation of gene expression at the translational level, going beyond traditional transcriptome analysis. In this study, we systematically profiled the translatome landscapes of hematopoietic cells, and unraveled novel insights on HSC functionality and regulation mechanisms. Moreover, for further exploring underlying regulation mechanisms of translatome, we systematically screened the snoRNAs in hematopoietic cells and uncovered an indispensable role for the maternally expressed snoRNA cluster SNORD113-114 at the Dlk1-Gtl2 imprinting region in regulation of HSC self-renewal. Maternal knockout of this cluster (Mat-KO) significantly impaired HSC self-renewal, while loss of the paternal allele caused no obvious abnormal hematological phenotype. Mechanistically, Mat-KO resulted in dysregulation of translation machinery, in terms of 2'-O-Me modifications on rRNAs, rRNA processing, ribosome function and translatome. Finally, Loss of SNORD113-114 cluster induced impaired ribosome biogenesis checkpoint/nucleolar stress in HSCs, which exempted p53 from proteasomal degradation and eventually led to apoptosis in HSCs. Collectively, our findings shed light on the intricate molecular mechanisms governing HSC behavior and provide potential therapeutic targets for enhancing HSC function and advancing regenerative medicine. Understanding the translation regulation of gene expression in HSCs has significant implications for stem cell biology and offers promising avenues for clinical applications. Overall design: To investigate the translation regulation in hematopoietic cells, we performed ultra-low input Ribo-seq on 10 types of hematopoietic cells, which were sorted by FACS. WT HSCs, along with Mat-KO HSCs losing SNORD113-114 cluster, were also sorted and subjected to ultra-low input Ribo-seq. The RPF fragment isolated from these sorted hematopoietic cells were then converted to sequencing library for RNA-seq. Each cell type contains 2 biological replicates, which contains 2 technical replicates each, so there are 4 replicates in all for each cell type. Translatome profile, that is results of RNA-seq of RPF fragments, were then analyzed and compared between 10 hematopoietic cells.  Analysis and comparison were also carried out between WT and Mat-KO HSCs."
