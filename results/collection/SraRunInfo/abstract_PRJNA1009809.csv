"Time course analysis of tRNA abundance during zebrafish early embryonic development. Overall design: Wild-type (TLAB strain) zebrafish embryos were grown in standard housing conditions.Unfertilized eggs (0 hours post-fertilization; hpf) were collected or embryos were staged and collected at consecutive developmental time-points, namelyat the 256-cell (2.5 hpf), 1000-cell (3 hpf), sphere (4 hpf), shield (6 hpf) and bud (10 hpf) stages. Eggs and embryos were either flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen or immediately processed. Samples were used for western blotting analysis, polysome profiling, ribosome profiling or mRNA and tRNA sequencing for investigating the regulation of tRNA gene expression and translational status during early zebrafish embryogenesis."
