abstract
"The CCR4-NOT complex is a major regulator of eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA) stability. Slow decoding during translation promotes association of CCR4-NOT with ribosomes, accelerating mRNA degradation. We applied selective ribosome profiling to further investigate the determinants of CCR4-NOT recruitment to ribosomes in mammalian cells. This revealed that specific arginine codons in the P-site are strong signals for ribosomal recruitment of human CNOT3, a CCR4-NOT subunit. Cryoâ€“electron microscopy and transfer RNA (tRNA) mutagenesis demonstrated that the D-arms of select arginine tRNAs interact with CNOT3 and promote its recruitment whereas other tRNA D-arms sterically clash with CNOT3. These effects link codon content to mRNA stability. Thus, in addition to their canonical decoding function, tRNAs directly engage regulatory complexes during translation, a mechanism we term P-site tRNA-mediated mRNA decay. Overall design: To determine transcriptome-wide effect of CNOT3 depletion on mRNA stability, we depleted CNOT3 expression in HEK293T cells using CRISPR/Cas9, and then measured mRNA half-life in CNOT3-depleted cells and control cells using SLAM-Seq."
